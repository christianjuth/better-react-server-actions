# Getting Started

So you're like me and you love Server Actions, but you **need more Zod and TypeScript**!

### Why Use This Library?

* Server action validation with [`zod-form-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod-form-data)
* Server error handling
* Amazing TypeScript DX
* Doesn't break [`useActionState` progressive enhancement](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-actions#progressive-enhancement-with-useactionstate)
* No dependencies other then `zod`/`zod-form-data`

### Why React 19+ is required

This library is designed to enhance `useActionState`, which requires React 19. Without that, you really won't get much benefit from this library.

I have only tested with Next.js for now, but the goal is to make this work with React in general.

## Installation

Ensure you have React 19 and Next.js 15 setup ([instructions](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-rc)).

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install -S better-react-server-actions zod zod-form-data
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add better-react-server-actions zod zod-form-data
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm add better-react-server-actions zod zod-form-data
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
