# Getting Started

### Why Use This Library?

* Server action validation with [`zod-form-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod-form-data)
* Server error handling
* Amazing TypeScript DX
* Doesn't break [`useActionState` progressive enhancement](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-actions#progressive-enhancement-with-useactionstate)
* No dependencies other then `zod-form-data`

### Why React 19+ is required

This library is designed to enhance `useServerAction`, which requires React 19. Without that, you really won't get much benefit from this library.

## Installation

Ensure you have React 19 and Next.js 15 setup ([instructions](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-rc)).
